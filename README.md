# CP - A time of Youth

## Overview
This repository showcases my journey in Competitive Programming (CP) from high school to the present. It includes various types of problems I've solved, categorized by algorithmic paradigms such as recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming, graph theory, and more. Each section contains problems, their solutions, and explanations to help others understand the approaches used.

## Categories

### Recursion
Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. Here are some classic recursion problems:
- **Factorial Calculation**
  - Problem: Compute the factorial of a given number.
- **Fibonacci Sequence**
  - Problem: Generate the nth Fibonacci number.
- **Tower of Hanoi**
  - Problem: Solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

### Backtracking
Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems incrementally by trying partial solutions and then abandoning them if they are not suitable.
- **N-Queens Problem**
  - Problem: Place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
- **Sudoku Solver**
  - Problem: Solve a given Sudoku puzzle.
- **Subset Sum Problem**
  - Problem: Determine if there is a subset of the given set with a sum equal to a given number.

### Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem just once.
- **Knapsack Problem**
  - Problem: Given weights and values of items, determine the maximum value that can be carried in a knapsack of a given capacity.
- **Longest Common Subsequence**
  - Problem: Find the longest subsequence common to two sequences.
- **Coin Change Problem**
  - Problem: Given a set of coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount.

### Graph Theory
Graph theory involves the study of graphs and their properties. It is used to model pairwise relations between objects.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - Problem: Traverse a graph using DFS.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - Problem: Traverse a graph using BFS.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
  - Problem: Find the shortest path from a source to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
